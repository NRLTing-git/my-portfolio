This study examines two datasets: one from the London Fire Brigade with fire incident data and another with UK Food Standards Agency restaurant ratings. The aim was to determine if restaurant density or food safety ratings correlate with fire incidents. The analysis revealed that areas with more restaurants experienced more fire incidents, but food safety ratings did not significantly impact fire occurrence. In summary, this study sheds light on the link between restaurant density, safety ratings, and fire incidents in London, emphasizing the importance of vigilance in densely populated restaurant areas, irrespective of safety ratings.

in conclusion 
The Number of Restaurants and Fire Incidence

Our analysis revealed a statistically significant positive correlation (r = 0.79) between the number of restaurants per postcode and the frequency of fire incidents.

The Food Safety Ratings and Fire Incidence

Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we did not find a significant correlation between the average food safety rating per postcode and the number of fire incidents in that postcode (hygiene r=.02, structural r=.21, management r=.19)

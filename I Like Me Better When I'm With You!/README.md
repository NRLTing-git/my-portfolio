n the study, a mentorship model for the music industry was aimed to be developed, leveraging advanced data processing techniques to pair emerging artists with established mentors. Billboard’s Year-End Top Artists data and Wikipedia were utilized, with the aim of bridging the gap between new and experienced artists, offering a strategic path for industry navigation. Tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine distance measurement were involved in the approach.

The robustness of the model was ensured through manual labelling and inter-rater reliability checks, resulting in a list of potential mentors. The accuracy of this model was demonstrated by precision and recall metrics. A moderate agreement among raters in identifying suitable mentors was indicated by a Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.57. This validation process led to the identification of 31 appropriate mentors.

Among the five results of the information retrieval system, three have been labelled as mentors by our raters. Steve Lacey and Lauv, the first two results, are in the same record label as Laufey which enables them to promote the record label further. Meanwhile, the top 3 artist, Norah Jones, has recently collaborated with Laufey in a mini-EP which also positions her as a possible choice for being a mentor given their relationship.

The effectiveness of the information retrieval system was evaluated using a confusion matrix. The system exhibited a precision of 0.6 and a recall rate of 0.0097. The Precision-Recall curve showed high precision for top-ranked mentor-mentee matches, but a sharp decrease in precision was noted beyond the top three matches. The area under the PR curve calculated at 0.2179 and suggested significant room for improrvement in the model.

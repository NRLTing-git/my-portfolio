This study explores the use of autoencoders as a data preprocessing step to improve feature 
separation by latent factor extraction. Data Compression through various methods is useful in Data 
Science to improve feature separation or as feature engineering or vectorization. Our study furthers 
this by attempting to make a universalizable method for preprocessing by using a proximity matrix 
and then an autoencoder to use relationships between rows as the primary features that we extract 
and use for clustering. Clustering is done with K-means and Wardâ€™s clustering algorithms, and the 
best performing results are noted. We evaluate this method over five University of Irving public 
datasets commonly used as benchmarks and show in which cases that the method can effectively 
improve feature extraction and thus the clustering results.

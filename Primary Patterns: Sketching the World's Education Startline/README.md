In this folder, we showcase the capability of different cluseting techniques. 
The dataset used was World Development Index, a comprehensive dataset with diverse global data, focusing specifically on educational aspects.
The primary objectives were to unearth patterns in global educational data, understand the diversity of educational systems, and relate foundational education to overall educational outcomes.
The desired outcome was to categorize countries based on shared educational traits to aid in benchmarking and inform policy decisions.

Our results shows that there are two possible clusters:
cluster 1: encompassing countries like Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Austria, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela, 
            is characterized by consistent and higher educational rates. This cluster demonstrates shorter, more uniform compulsory
            education durations and a higher intake of females in both primary and secondary education, indicating a focus on gender parity.
            Additionally, higher net primary enrollment rates, fewer over-aged students, and a lower rate of repeaters in these countries suggest efficient educational progress,
            despite the diverse challenges specific to each nation's context, such as rural access or political influences.

cluster 2: This cluster includes countries like Burundi, Burkina Faso, Dominican Republic, Djibouti, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Ghana, India,
            Morocco, and Laos, exhibiting a broader range in educational metrics. This cluster's diverse educational systems are reflected in longer durations of primary education and varied starting ages,
            indicative of different national policies. The higher reliance on private schooling and variable repeater rates within these countries point to challenges in the public education system,
            particularly in developing nations where educational quality and access remain key issues.
            
While these clusters provide an overview of more developed (Cluster 1) versus developing (Cluster 2) education systems, 
it's crucial to remember that each country within a cluster has unique educational strengths and weaknesses. 
This underscores the need for a deeper, more nuanced understanding of each country's specific educational landscape to inform targeted and effective educational strategies.

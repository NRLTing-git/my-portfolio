The study explores using LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude, along with the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm, to create synthetic data for enhancing emotion detection models.
A logistic regression model trained on a combination of real and LLM-generated synthetic data achieved comparable accuracies up to 78.5% and 78.8% respectively,
demonstrating the viability of using LLMs to effectively mimic real data distributions. Key factors include providing LLMs with data exemplars and using SHAP to
identify emotion-associated keywords to guide the generation process. The study highlights the potential of LLMs to overcome data constraints and unlock AI capabilities
through informed prompt engineering and interpretability methods.

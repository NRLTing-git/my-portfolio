This study explores the key determinants of success for artists featured on Billboard's Top 100 charts. By showcasing the successful strategies of Billboard chart-toppers, the study offers insight for new artists and aids record labels in making informed decisions about signing and promoting emerging talent. Leveraging data from Billboard and Wikipedia, the study employs latent semantic analysis to identify factors influencing an artist's success in the music industry. Artist data was scraped from the Billboard Year-End Top 100 Artists and the sidebars of their respective Wikipedia articles. Tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) were applied to the design matrix to find the optimal number of components or latent factors that describe the data. After truncating the design matrix with singular value decomposition (SVD), a dimensionality reduction technique used in LSA, 504 components were found. The first 10 factors together with the corresponding top 10 features from the original design matrix were then used to interpret the data.

Key findings of the study are found below:

1. The study reveals a dominance of U.S.-based artists in the Billboard charts, particularly those in genres such as pop, rock, and hip-hop. <br>
2. Emerging Trends: While traditional genres persist, the study identifies a growing appreciation for emerging trends like reggaeton, EDM, and R&B, suggesting a shift in listener preferences. <br>
3. The prominence of international artists indicates global opportunities for diversification, urging record labels to adopt comprehensive strategies beyond regional boundaries.
